{% include about.html %}

<p>My mathematical interests are in algebraic geometry, noncommutative algebra and higher structures, in particular I like to think about:
<ul>
  <li>the structure of derived categories, via exceptional collections and semiorthogonal decompositions
  <li>deformation theory and Hochschild cohomology
  <li>moduli spaces of sheaves on (noncommutative) varieties
  <li>representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras
  <li>...
</ul>

<p>Besides mathematics, I am interested in LaTeX (and typesetting in general). I also like playing classical guitar, writing counterpoint and fugues, and reading.
