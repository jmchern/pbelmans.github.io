<h1 class="post-title">Exceptional collections for finite-dimensional algebras and partial flag varieties</h1>
<p>In the Sommersemester 2020 we will run a seminar on exceptional collections in representation theory, first discussing the general theory for finite-dimensional algebras, and then we focus on derived categories of partial flag varieties and the representation theory of algebraic groups. The goal is to
<ul>
  <li>get familiar with exceptional collections and their applications in algebra, algebraic geometry and representation theory
  <li>discuss them in the context of coherent sheaves, and the conjecture that the derived category has a full exceptional collection
</ul>

<p>More details will be provided later on.

<p>An <strong>organisational meeting</strong> takes place on Wednesday, February 5, at 10h15, in 0.011. If you would like to give a talk but can't make it on Wednesday, please send me an email, especially if you are a Bonn graduate student.
