<h1 class="post-title">Exceptional collections on partial flag varieties</h1>
<p>In the Sommersemester 2020 we will run a seminar on exceptional collections on partial flag varieties. The goal is to
<ul>
  <li>get familiar with exceptional collections and their applications in algebra, algebraic geometry and representation theory
  <li>discuss them in the context of perverse sheaves
  <li>discuss them in the context of coherent sheaves, and the conjecture that the derived category has a full exceptional collection
</ul>

<p>More details will be provided later on.
