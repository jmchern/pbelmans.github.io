<h1>Problem list for the homological projective duality seminar</h1>

<p>On this page we can collect some interesting questions, projects and problems for the homological projective duality seminar. They are in no particular order. They might be trivial, or impossible, or wrong, or somehow all three of them simultaneously.

<p>If you want to add something, please get in touch with either Daniel or me. If you want to work on something, please get in touch with either Daniel, me, or the person who came up with the description.

  <li><p><strong>Homological projective duality for weighted projective lines</strong>

    <p>Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a weighted projective line, and $\mathcal{C}\to\mathbb{P}(V)=\mathbb{P}^1$ be the coarse moduli space. We have a Lefschetz center given by $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{C}}$ and all the line bundles originating from the root stack construction.
    <p>Taking hyperplane sections (i.e. just considering the fibre over a point!) generically gives nothing in the complement, but if we consider hyperplanes which intersect (i.e. points which are inn) the root locus, we need $n_p-1$ additional objects. Hence the homological projective dual looks like a bunch of points (number depending on the size of the root operation at each point) mapping to the root locus.
    <p>Can we make this precise? How general can we make this result? We are after all modifying the homological projective dual of $\mathbb{P}^1$ (also known as $\emptyset$) by adding things associated to the root locus.

  <li><p><strong>Homological projective duality for noncommutative projective planes finite over their center</strong>

    <p>This is too technical for a quick description. I'm not even convinced what I have in mind is correct (unlike the above example). If you know what a noncommutative projective plane finite over its center is, feel free to get in touch!

  <li><p><strong>Homological projective duality for intersections of quadrics</strong>

    <p>Continuing the work in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09832">Homological projective duality for quadrics</a> by Kuznetsov&ndash;Perry, can we do homological projective duality for the intersection of 2 quadrics? This seems to be not in the literature?
    <p>The conjectural picture (if I didn't mess up) is that the homological projective dual is either a family (over the dual projective space) of hyperelliptic curves (resp. weighted projective lines with all weights equal to 2), depending on the parity of the dimension. Over the critical locus we need some degenerations of these (in the weighted projective line case I could imagine root operations in fat points).
    <p>Is there any work on this already? Is it somehow implied by various categorical joins vs. intersections results?

  <li><p><strong>Homological projective duality for Veronese embeddings</strong>

    <p>According to line -7 of page 13 of <a href="http://www.cantab.net/users/t.logvinenko/talks/Alexander%20Kuznetsov%20-%20Homological%20Projective%20Duality%20%5Btypeset%5D.pdf">these lecture notes</a> there is a precise expectation for the homological projective dual of $\mathbb{P}^n$ under <em>higher</em> Veronese embeddings.
    <p>Can we make this suggestion precise? Is there any work on this already?

  <li><p><strong>Homological projective duality for Tevelev's extremal varieties</strong>

    <p>Various varieties in ordinary projective duality exhibit extremal behavior: low degree of the dual variety (= codegree), Severi varieties, Scorza varieties, varieties (in particular $G/P$) with positive defect, self-dual varieties (amongst the $G/P$), ... I am referring to <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2113135">Tevelev, Projective duality and homogeneous spaces</a> in what follows.
    <ul>
      <li>self-duality: As per theorem 9.5, describe the homological projective dual of $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^n\hookrightarrow\mathbb{P}^{2n-1}$ (the others are already in the literature)
      <li>positive defect: See theorem 7.56, not sure if this is as interesting as the others?
      <li>Scorza varieties: Segre embedding of $\mathbb{P}^n\times\mathbb{P}^m$ for $|n-m|\leq 1$ is of interest here? Is it interesting on the derived categories level though?
      <li>small codegree, $\operatorname{codeg}X=3$: of the classification from theorem 8.7, consider $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^2$ via Segre (which is self-dual) and its hyperplane section, and projection of Severi varieties (Severi varieties themselves are either done, or work-in-progress for the Cayley plane)
      <li>small codegree, $\operatorname{codeg}X=4$: conjectural classification in op. cit., make your favourite pick
    </ul>
    <p>I'm not suggestig that these are necessarily the most applicable results, but it seems relevant to consider these very concrete examples as at least their projective geometry is particularly rich and interesting.
