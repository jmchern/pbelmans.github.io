<p>A week late. Whoops.

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11261v1">Leonid Positselski, Olaf Schn√ºrer: The inclusion of small modules into big ones: Is it fully faithful on unbounded derived categories?</a> is an interesting preprint discussing the features (or pathologies) of derived categories one needs to be aware of. An often used method is to describe a subcategory of the derived category, by restricting the cohomology of objects that you consider, instead of considering the derived category of a subcategory of the abelian category. This preprint explains when you can do this, and also when you can <em>not</em> do this.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08265v1">Giovanni Cerulli Irelli: Three lectures on quiver Grassmannians</a> makes for some nice reading material on quiver Grassmannians, with many explicit examples. I like explicit examples.

  <li><p><a href="https://www.daniellitt.com/blog/2020/3/26/reflections-on-agonize-and-online-conferences">Reflections on AGONIZE and online conferences</a> is an interesting insight in Daniel Litt's experiences with running an online conference.

  <li><p><a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex2bibitem">biblatex2bibitem</a> is a very convenient package if you are like me, a stubborn advocate of biblatex and biber, in a world where arXiv uses a version which is incompatible with TeX Live's latest release.
</ul>
