<p>I skipped two weeks as I was visiting Tata Institute, but we're back now.

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~giulia/groupedetravail.html">Groupe de travail : Composantes de Kuznetsov, stabilit√©, espaces de modules</a> contains notes from a seminar on Kuznetsov components and moduli spaces for Bridgeland-stable objects in them.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07961v1">Dylan Spence: Reconstruction of projective curves from the derived category</a> shows how to deal with (nasty) singularities and reconstruct the curve from the derived category. Cool stuff!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10001v1">Severin Barmeier, Zhengfang Wang: Deformations of path algebras of quivers with relations</a> gives a very explicit method to describe and understand deformations of path algebras with relations, discussing many (geometric!) examples of this on the go.
</ul>
