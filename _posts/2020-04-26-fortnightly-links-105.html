<p>Apologies if I have missed your amazing arXiv preprint, but somehow I haven't written down any the past 2 weeks.

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~antoine.chambert-loir/enseignement/2019-20/gt/index.xhtml">Topics in tropical geometry</a> are lecture notes (<a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~antoine.chambert-loir/enseignement/2019-20/gt/toptrop.pdf">pdf</a>) by Antoine Chambert-Loir on tropical geometry. Ideal lockdown reading material!

  <li><p>This week I woke up and I said to myself: having an arXiv diff tool would be great. Turns out someone (no idea who!) already implemented this at <a href="https://arxivdiff.com">arxivdiff.com</a>. Great!

  <li><p>The following link is not mathematical at all, but it has been an important project of mine in the past weeks, in the light of the COVID-19 crisis: <a href="https://maakjemondmasker.be">maakjemondmasker.be</a> is a project which we started over a month ago, providing people with information on how to make your own face masks and how to use them. There are <em>absolutely amazing</em> people working on this project, and it's great to leave your little academia bubble a bit, whilst contributing my at best mediocre web development skills to the good cause.
</ul>
