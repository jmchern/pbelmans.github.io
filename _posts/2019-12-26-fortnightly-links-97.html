  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06935">Alexander Perry, Laura Pertusi, Xiaolei Zhao: Stability conditions and moduli spaces for Kuznetsov components of Gushel-Mukai varieties</a> develops the machinery on stability conditions in families in the case of Gushel&ndash;Mukai varieties. These are (at least in dimension 4) somewhat parallel to cubic 4-folds, with very precise conjectures about their geometry and rationality. For cubics there are two conjectures concerning their rationality (one in terms of a Hodge-theoretically associated K3 surface, due to Hassett, and one in terms of a categorically associated K3 surface, due to Kuznetsov) which are recently proven to be equivalent.
  <p>The intriguing result (for me) is that for Gushel&ndash;Mukai 4-folds the analogous conjectures are <em>not</em> equivalent!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04957v1">Yves Andr√©, Luisa Fiorot: On the canonical, fpqc, and finite topologies on affine schemes. The state of the art</a> discusses how some very classical questions regarding Grothendieck topologies on affine schemes, and relates them to very recent techniques (involving splinters, and prisms). The <a href="https://pbelmans.ncag.info/topologies-comparison/">geographer in me</a> likes these types of results.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04332v1">Chunyi Li, Howard Nuer, Paolo Stellari, Xiaolei Zhao: A refined derived Torelli Theorem for Enriques surfaces</a> discusses how for all but a codimension-2 subset of the moduli space of Enriques surfaces, the "Kuznetsov component" of the derived category of the Enriques surface (orthogonal to 10 completely orthogonal line bundles) determines the surface uniquely. I have seen talks about this result, and I quite like the approach of studying 3-spherical objects!
