<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://atricolfi.github.io/Intro_Enumerative_Geometry.pdf">Andrea Ricolfi: Introduction to enumerative geometry</a> are a beautiful set of lecture notes (in progress) on enumerative geometry. If the link is broken, it should be possible to find the newest version via Andrea's webpage.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01242v1">Igor Burban, Yuriy Drozd: Morita theory for non-commutative noetherian schemes</a> amongst other things proves an noncommutative version of Gabriel's reconstruction theorem: the central subscheme is determined purely in terms of the abelian category of quasicoherent sheaves. Cool stuff!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11423v1">Ciro Ciliberto, Mikhail Zaidenberg: Lines, conics, and all that</a> gives a big literature overview of Fano schemes of lines, conics and all that (sic). 481 references!
