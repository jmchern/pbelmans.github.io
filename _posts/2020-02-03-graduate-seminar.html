<p>Next semester (which in Bonn runs from roughly April to July) we will be running a (graduate) seminar on exceptional collections, with a view towards partial flag varieties. The two main goals are:
<ul>
  <li>to familiarise ourselves with derived categories of finite-dimensional algebras, and important concepts such as Ringel duality and quasi-hereditary algebras
  <li>to familiarise ourselves with the geometry of partial flag varieties, and their derived categories, to understand the existence and structure of exceptional collections
</ul>
<p>We will have an organisational meeting this Wednesday, at 10h15 in room 0.011. If you would like to give a talk but can't make it on Wednesday, please send me an email, especially if you are a Bonn graduate student.
<p>For more details (to come), see the <a href="/teaching/exceptional-collections-2020">seminar webpage</a>, with a detailed program likely appearing tomorrow, and otherwise on Wednesday.
