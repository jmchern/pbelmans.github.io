<p>A second fortnightly links within a week, what is this madness?

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://mathieu.anel.free.fr/mat/doc/Anel-Catren-NewSpacesTOC.pdf">New spaces in mathematics and physics</a> is a "collective book project", roughly based on a conference in 2015, discussing the directions in which geometry is evolving. So far the book is still unpublished, but roughly half of the links in the table of contents are <em>clickable</em> and lead to preprint versions of these chapters.
  <p>The chapter which is closest to my interests (i.e. the one of Kontsevich) is not yet available though, I will have to wait for the published version to read it I guess.

  <li><p><a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/huybrech/NoebelBach.pdf">Christian NÃ¶bel: Higher degree symmetric powers</a> is a bachelor thesis (under the supervision of <a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/~huybrech/">Daniel Huybrechts</a>), which explains how symmetric powers of curves actually determine the curve, i.e. a Torelli-type result.
  <p>Aside from the nice exposition, it points out an issue in the literature for the case of $g=2$ and $\operatorname{Sym}^dC$ with $d\geq 3$.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03509v1">Alexander Soibelman: Lecture notes on quiver representations and moduli problems in algebraic geometry</a> is what it says it is. They look very well-written, and give a nice overview.
</ul>
