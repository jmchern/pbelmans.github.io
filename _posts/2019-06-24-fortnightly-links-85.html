  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03432v1">Mark Green, Yoon-Joo Kim, Radu Laza, Colleen Robles: The LLV decomposition of hyper-Kaehler cohomology</a> gives the weight decomposition of the cohomology of a hyperk채hler variety under the action of the Looijenga&ndash;Lunts&ndash;Verbitsky Lie algebra, and uses this to determine the Betti numbers of O'Grady 10 (<a href="{% post_url 2019-05-09-hodge-numbers-OG10 %}">previously featured on this blog</a>) in a what feels to me more conceptual way, starting from the Euler number and the vanishing of odd cohomology. This method works for O'Grady 10 because it has a relatively large second Betti number (so a relatively large Lie algebra).

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08081v1">Lenny Taelman: Derived equivalences of hyperk채hler varieties</a> shows how the Lie algebra which featured in the previous fortnightly link is actually a derived invariant (at least for a hyperk채hler variety). Having this new derived invariant allows one to study the action of auto-equivalences on it, and this is what is used to describe the auto-equivalence group of hyperk채hler varieties (a complete answer is only known for K3 surfaces).

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03594v1">Arnaud Beauville, Vector bundles on Fano threefolds and K3 surfaces</a> shows how moduli of vector bundles on K3 surfaces are related to moduli of vector bundles on Fano 3-folds for which they are anticanonical sections.

  <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBUbKAztDOI&list=PLq3E5oubNNoBSdJr_hJdyrEt8DIpz3fLV&index=3%2C">Maxim Kontsevich, Birational invariants from quantum cohomology</a> is the video of a talk of Kontsevich at the recent <a href="http://hms.mirrorsymmetry.ru/">homological mirror symmetry conference</a> in Moscow. The other videos are also available, but let me point out that he suggests their new results are strong enough to prove non-rationality of the very general cubic fourfold (this is mentioned around 2:20). For the flavor of their invariants on the level of the Grothendieck group, one can go to 56:00, to see the definition of a new invariant $\mathrm{K}_0(\mathrm{Var}/k)\to\mathbb{Z}$.
