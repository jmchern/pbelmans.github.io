  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03163">Alexander Perry: The integral Hodge conjecture for two-dimensional Calabi-Yau categories</a> is a must-read (if you have the time and necessary background).

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03223">Indranil Biswas, Tomas L. Gomez: On vector bundles over moduli spaces trivial on Hecke curves</a> proves an interesting result for moduli of vector bundles on a curve, whose geometry I find very interesting. It's analogous to the result that if $\mathcal{E}$ is a vector bundle on $\mathbb{P}^n$, such that $\mathcal{E}|_L\cong\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}^{\oplus r}$ for every line on $\mathbb{P}^n$, then $\mathcal{E}$ is itself trivial. For $\mathrm{M}_C(r,\mathcal{L})$, the same result holds, where the role of lines is played by "rational curves of minimal degree", also known as Hecke curves (which have an explicit modular interpretation).

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04982">David Favero, Daniel Kaplan, Tyler L. Kelly: A maximally-graded invertible cubic threefold that does not admit a full exceptional collection of line bundles</a> gives a counterexample to the Lekili-Ueda conjecture on the existence of a full exceptional collection of line bundles for a Landau&ndash;Ginzburg model, which is itself analogous to King's conjecture on the existence of a full exceptional collection of line bundles for a smooth projective toric variety. The latter is known to be false since 2006, by Hille&ndash;Perling. Now the Landau--Ginzburg model version for invertible polynomials is also known to be false.
