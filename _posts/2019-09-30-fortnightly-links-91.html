  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07758v1">Ciaran Meachan, Theo Raedschelders: Hochschild cohomology and deformations of $\mathbb{P}$-functors</a> is a very interesting preprint by two authors with unprononouncable names, generalising the Huybrechts&ndash;Thomas adagium that $\mathbb{P}^n$-objects are hyperplane sections of spherical objects to the relative setting of functors. By doing so, one gets a really interesting contribution from the <em>noncommutative</em> deformation theory of the domain category, even if one only works with geometric deformations of the codomain category. A highly recommended read if you have somewhat similar interests as me, and care about the role of Hochschild cohomology in algebraic geometry as much as I do.

  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11033">Genki Ouchi: Automorphism groups of cubic fourfolds and K3 categories</a> (and in particular theorem 1.2) answers a question I asked some people 2 weeks ago at the <a href="http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~arizzard/workshop2019.html">The geometry of derived categories workshop</a>, and it's nice to see such a concise answer. In particular, the <em>automorphism group</em> of a cubic fourfold is isomorphic to the <em>subgroup</em> of the autoequivalence group of its K3 category <em>preserving a stability condition</em>. I'm a big fan of this slogan, and I would be very interested in seeing more instances of this phenomenon.

  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11437">Benjamin Antieau, Bhargav Bhatt, Akhil Mathew: Counterexamples to Hochschild&ndash;Kostant&ndash;Rosenberg in characteristic $p$</a> shows that one of my favourite results (namely the Hochschild&ndash;Kostant&ndash;Rosenberg decomposition) <em>fails</em> in some examples for sufficiently small positive characteristic. This is one of the coolest results of the year for me. I might want to revisit this paper in an expository blogpost, once I've read it carefully.

  <li><a href="http://manivel.perso.math.cnrs.fr/Topics.pdf">Laurent Manivel: Topics on the geometry of homogeneous spaces</a> are lecture notes on recent developments, and the selection is described by the author as <q>largely arbitrary and mainly reflects the interests of the author</q>. Luckily these choices are closely aligned with what I (and hopefully you) find interesting, so they make for a very interesting read.
