<p>It's interesting how things can get postponed, it's like a psychological experiment I perform on myself seeing when I actually put up fortnightly links.

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04626v1">Michael Brown and Mark Walker: Standard conjecture D for matrix factorizations</a> shows that the noncommutative analogue for Grothendieck's conjecture D (which says that numerical equivalence agrees with homological equivalence) holds for categories of matrix factorisations. The proof goes via lots of cool Hodge theory.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07756v1">Ciro Ciliberto: The classification of complex algebraic surfaces</a> is what the title says, a really nice set of lecture notes on the classification of algebraic surfaces.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13287v1">Christian Schnell: The Fourier&ndash;Mukai transform made easy</a> revisits the <em>first</em> result on Fourier&ndash;Mukai transforms. It shows that an alternative point-of-view on the equivalence of categories provided by the Poincar√© line bundle, where sprinkling a bit of Grothendieck duality on the definition makes the statements cleaner and more conceptual.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02261">Nicolas Addington, Benjamin Antieau, Sarah Frei, Katrina Honigs: Rational points and derived equivalence</a> is a really cool paper, exploring how derived categories behave over non-algebraically closed fields. What makes it extra interesting for me is to see how an essential part is contained in a computer algebra computation, whose subtleties are discussed at the end of the paper.
