<p>Here are some small updates, which do not deserve a blogpost of their own as such.
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://github.com/pbelmans/hodge-diamond-cutter">Hodge diamond cutter</a> now also computes Hodge diamonds for Fano varieties of linear subspaces on the intersection of 2 quadrics. For more on this, see (the references in) <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/327323/6263">this MathOverflow post</a> where I learned that these are objects that one can study.
  <li><p>I have updated the conference schedule at <a href="https://ncag.info">ncag.info</a> because of COVID-19 cancellations and postponements. Please let me know if I've missed something, or if your conference is not listed there.
  <li><p>Given the uncertainty about whether they will actually take place I will not announce them publicly yet, but I have added 2 conferences I'm co-organising to the <a href="/#conferences">list on my index page</a>
</ul>
<p>I guess I'll do a fortnightly links tomorrow.
