  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00155v1">Bronson Lim, Alexander Polishchuk: Bondal-Orlov fully faithfulness criterion for Deligne-Mumford stacks</a> gives a (no surprises there, given the title) fully faithfulness criterion for functors originating in the derived category of a Deligne&ndash;Mumford stack. There is now a role to be played by the automorphism groups of a point, so that one needs to suitable improve the condition to be checked.
    <p>It'll be fun to find applications of this!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12647v1">Marcello Bernardara, Sara Durighetto: A categorical invariant for geometrically rational surfaces with a conic bundle structure</a> shows how to define a Griffiths&ndash;Kuznetsov component in the derived category of a conic bundle (although it is not quite a uniquely defined subcategory, rather a direct sum of them, i.e. considered motivically).

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04733v1">Gregorio Baldi: Some remarks on motivical and derived invariants</a> is an interesting overview of conjectural derived invariants, and how the implications between them go.
    <p>In the light of the previously mentioned shift in the belief that Hodge numbers are <em>not</em> a derived invariant (also known as Kontsevich's conjecture), one sees that this would disprove Orlov's conjecture.
