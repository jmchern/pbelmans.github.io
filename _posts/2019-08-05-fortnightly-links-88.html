  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11441v1">Bumsig Kim, Alexander Polishchuk: Atiyah class and Chern character for global matrix factorizations</a> discusses how one can generalise the Atiyah class calculus which gives a very clean approach for the Hochschild&ndash;Kostant&ndash;Rosenberg decomposition to the case of (global) matrix factorisations. There is an ever-growing set of analogies between Lie algebras and algebraic geometry, and this forms a really interesting new chapter in it, see also <a href="https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~calaque/publications-HDR">appendix B of Damien Calaque's habilitation thesis</a>.

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11301v1">Eric M. Rains: The birational geometry of noncommutative surfaces</a> is a book-length preprint on noncommutative surfaces that I will not even attempt to do any justice to in a single paragraph. Let me just point out that for example an alternative (but equivalent) approach to noncommutative $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles is provided. Is anyone up for a reading seminar on this preprint, and/or the earlier <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08876">The noncommutative geometry of elliptic difference equations</a> by the same author?

  <p><small>I will probably write something about remark 3 in this preprint later this week. I've been intending to write a blogpost about this observation for a while now, and I guess I should really write it now.</small>

  <li><p><a href="https://cplx.vm.uni-freiburg.de/storage/software/ellipticcurve/wasm/ellipticcurve.html">Elliptic curves</a> is a fun and well-written browser tool to play around with elliptic curves and their equations. It's very instructive, say for students, to be able to do this from your browser.
