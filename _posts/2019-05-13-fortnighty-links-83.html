  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00872">Daniel Bergh and David Rydh: Functorial destackification and weak factorization of orbifolds</a> shows how to reduce the destackification problem to the case of abelian stabilizers, which is covered by the earlier paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5713">Functorial destackification and weak factorization of orbifolds</a> by the first author. This is cool stuff, and I think (but I haven't checked carefully) it is also a necessary step in the geometricity proof for smooth and proper Deligne&ndash;Mumford stacks, which is a result I really like.

  <li><p><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-perfectoid-spaces/">Lean perfectoid spaces</a> by Kevin Buzzard, Johan Commelin and Patrick Massot is a formalisation of the notion of a perfectoid space. Also check out the <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2019/05/11/perfectoid-spaces/">accompanying blogpost</a>, featuring a visualisation of how Lean sees the definition, in terms of the subfields we mathematicians recognise in the definition.

  <p>On a related note, <a href="https://github.com/ramonfmir/lean-scheme">Schemes in Lean</a> is a rewritten-from-scratch / cleaned up version of the formalisation of the notion of a scheme. These are exciting times to live in (but I am very much an outside for these things, unfortunately).

  <li><p>Chances are that you have already seen it, given how popular it was last week, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhNUjg9X4g8">Chalk of Champions</a> is a mockumentary about the famous Japanese chalk.
