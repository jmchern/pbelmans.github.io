  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12267v1">Benjamin Antieau, Daniel Bragg: Derived invariants from topological Hochschild homology</a> is a really interesting paper, making tools and results from topological variations of Hochschild homology (and closely related invariants) accessible to algebraic geometers. I saw a great talk by the first author 2 days ago in Warsaw, and the paper is equally pleasant to read.
  <p>An important highlight is that a counterexample to the Hochschild&ndash;Kostant&ndash;Rosenberg decomposition in small characteristic is announced, to be given in a different paper. The only thing I've learnt about it so far is that it is <q>a smooth projective approximation of the classifying stack $\mathrm{B}\mu_p$</q> but I am looking forward to learn more about it.

  <li><p><a href="https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/~tsygan/Part1_11.pdf">Richard Nest, Boris Tsygan: Cyclic homology</a> is a book-in-progress on cyclic homology (and other invariants, such as Hochschild (co)homology), for ($\mathrm{A}_\infty$-)algebras. It's already more than 200 pages, and promises to be an accessible read on some recent developments in the theory.
