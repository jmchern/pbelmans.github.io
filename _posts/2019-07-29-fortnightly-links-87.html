  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07070v1">Tarig Abdelgadir, Daniel Chan: Tensor stable moduli stacks and refined representations of quivers</a> is a really interesting preprint on how to circumvent the failure of Rosenberg's reconstruction theorem for algebraic stacks using (a shadow of) the monoidal structure. Cool stuff!

  <li><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08162v2">Dmitri Orlov: Finite-dimensional differential graded algebras and their geometric realizations</a> is a really interesting construction for the geometricity problem for smooth and proper dg algebras (which in general is still open): it is shown that for every <em>finite-dimensional</em> dg algebra its derived category can be embedded in the derived category of a smooth projective variety. Cool stuff!
  <p>Do you think there is a positive or negative answer to the general case?

  <li><p><del><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08721v1">Roland Abuaf: Derived invariance of the numbers $\mathrm{h}^{0,p}(X)$</a> delivers what its title says: using the dual notion of his notion of homological units Abuaf shows that at least a whole row of Hodge numbers in the Hodge diamond are a derived invariant.</del>
  <ins>The paper has been withdrawn.</ins>
  <p>Here the general consensus is I guess that there will be a positive answer. I'm looking forward to seeing a positive answer here!
  <ins>It seems that the general consensus is inching more and more towards a <em>negative</em> answer. Let me know if you have a counterexample!</ins>
